===== Fresh Install =====
Again, please make sure you install from within Webmin (Un-used Modules) then Refresh Modules to move the BIND link under Servers. This is the default screen.

In the upper left corner the icon that looks like a gear is the Module Config. In the upper right corner the icon looks like a "Play" button starts the service. When you configure RDC a "Refresh" button is added. Do not yet start it, but lets look at its home directory.

{{:opennic:setup:webminbind:base-002.png|The location and content of BIND's home}}
The location and the list of files might be different on a different distribution (Red-Hat, Slackware, or from Enterprises like Oracle).

==== Backup and Archive====
The difference between backup and archive is the location where they are stored - one is on-line, but going to be lost when the host is lost. The other is off-line, but remains available. These are your choices for backup:
  * A manual snapshot by Linode, which you should use for milestones such as before distribution upgrades.
  * Three automated backups by Linode, which you should use to recover from errors or attacks.
  * A compressed archive by Webmin, which you should use to save parts of the filesystem
  * A download / upload utility by Webmin, to keep off-line copies of your archives.

Use the listed above to plan and test your capacity to recover from errors, attacks or even from ransomware. These are very basic, simple measures to keep your service stacks functional.

The Webmin screen to schedule and create compressed archives of the filesystem.

Recover from off-line backup in case of sustained attack going back for weeks or months.

==== User Management ====
User management from the shell is expanded by Webmin several ways. The most advanced is Usermin via LDAP, which is not really necessary on single instances. However, using the Webmin Users and Groups modules is necessary to allow login via Webmin - otherwise the user is limited to ssh login only. Also - on production servers Webmin shall not be installed to reduce the number of software exploits. 

{{:opennic:setup:webminbind:base-005.png|Extended functionally for UNIX Users and Groups by Webmin}}
Webmin Users and Groups control access to Modules - but the UNIX user must also exist.

==== Module Management ====
These should be the IP4 addresses of the OpenNIC Tier-2s. Normally you use Google's 8.8.8.8 here, but if you enter only that this name-server is NOT going to function. Also note - this is different from the settings of your VPS network, which SHOULD use Google's.

{{:opennic:setup:webminbind:base-006.png|The DNS Administrator login}}
The DNS administrator has full access to the DNS module and a few others like backup/restore and download/upload.

==== Network Security ====
Debian does not assume anything about the purpose of the system, it does not install or configure additional software, and it does not start services by default. //iptables// is an exception to this, it is installed by default. However, it is not configured and it is not started. If you have installed a firewall software such as FirewallD - iptables is going to be started and managed by that software.

{{:opennic:setup:webminbind:base-007.png|Firewall is not configured by default}}
If you start iptables with a wrong configuration you might lose access to your instance!

==== Webmin Modules ====
Some modules in Webmin are matured and well-rounded - the BIND module, for example. Some are obsolete, no longer maintained, and these days they are only included for backwards compatibility - such as the Jabber IM Server. Some are mature and install from within Webmin, some needs to be installed from the shell and tell Webmin to look for them "Refresh Modules". 

{{:opennic:setup:webminbind:base-008.png|Module installation}}
Webmin has good support for FirewallD - but it must be installed from the shell.

==== Logging ====
Webmin provides access to several logging facilities, with management for logging added for BIND and for Webmin.

{{:opennic:setup:webminbind:base-009.png|The standard UNIX logs }}
Security starts with these logs, as nearly all attacks leave some clues in these logs.
