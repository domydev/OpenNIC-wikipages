===== Debian 9 with Webmin 1.9xx Fresh Install =====
Again, please make sure you install from within Webmin (Un-used Modules) then Refresh Modules to move the BIND link under Servers. This is the default screen.
{{:opennic:setup:webminbind:base-001.png|The newly installed Webmin BIND module}}
In the upper left corner the icon that looks like a gear is the Module Config. In the upper right corner the icon looks like a "Play" button starts the service. When you configure RDC a "Refresh" button is added. Do not yet start it, but lets look at its home directory.

{{:opennic:setup:webminbind:base-002.png|The location and content of BIND's home}}
The location and the list of files might be different on a different distribution (Red-Hat, Slackware, or from Enterprises like Oracle).

==== Backup and Archive====
The difference between backup and archive is the location where they are stored - one is on-line, but going to be lost when the host is lost. The other is off-line, but remains available. These are your choices for backup:
  * A manual snapshot by Linode, which you should use for milestones such as before distribution upgrades.
  * Three automated backups by Linode, which you should use to recover from errors or attacks.
  * A compressed archive by Webmin, which you should use to save parts of the filesystem
  * A download / upload utility by Webmin, to keep off-line copies of your archives.

Use the listed above to plan and test your capacity to recover from errors, attacks or even from ransomware. These are very basic, simple measures to keep your service stacks functional.

{{:opennic:setup:webminbind:base-003.png|Webmin Filesystem Backup with scheduling}}
The Webmin screen to schedule and create compressed archives of the filesystem.

{{:opennic:setup:webminbind:base-004.png|Save and restore copies of your on-line backup}}
Recover from off-line backup in case of sustained attack going back for weeks or months.

=== User Management ===
User management from the shell is expanded by Webmin several ways. The most advanced is Usermin via LDAP, which is not really necessary on single instances. However, using the Webmin Users and Groups modules is necessary to allow login via Webmin - otherwise the user is limited to ssh login only. Also - on production servers Webmin shall not be installed to reduce the number of software exploits. 

{{:opennic:setup:webminbind:base-005.png|Extended functionally for UNIX Users and Groups by Webmin}}
Webmin Users and Groups control access to Modules - but the UNIX user must also exist.

=== Module Management ===
These should be the IP4 addresses of the OpenNIC Tier-2s. Normally you use Google's 8.8.8.8 here, but if you enter only that this name-server is NOT going to function. Also note - this is different from the settings of your VPS network, which SHOULD use Google's.

{{:opennic:setup:webminbind:base-006.png|The DNS Administrator login}}
The DNS administrator has full access to the DNS module and a few others like backup/restore and download/upload.

=== DNSSEC Initialization ===
Access both screens, and set as you wish. Webmin fully automates the re-signing process, and the default 21 days is acceptable.

=== Module Config ===
Finally, click on the gear in the upper left corner, and change from the defaults:

If you want to run under chroot set it here.\\ 
If reverse zone is REQUIRED leave it, otherwise set to NO.\\
