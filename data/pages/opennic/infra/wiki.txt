===== The Infrastructure =====
The wiki.opennic.org website runs as simple virtual machine on Fusl's private infrastructure for open source projects shared with [[https://www.archiveteam.org/|Archive Team]] and others at [[https://nforce.com/|NFOrce]] in the Netherlands (Nedzone Datacenter).

==== git sync ====
The entire web root directory is synced to [[https://github.com/opennic/wikipages|GitHub]] approximately every 60 minutes using a [[https://github.com/opennic/packers/blob/master/opennic-wiki/files-pre/etc/cron.hourly/gitsync|crontab script]]. Some files are [[https://github.com/opennic/wikipages/blob/master/.gitignore|excluded]] from being synchronized to the git repository.
